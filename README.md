Helpful mini scripts and apps for Mac OS X.
    
I have a number of scripts I've built and use for myself. This repository specifically covers the ones that are set up for use with the Automator program in the Max OS. Workflows can be installed to add right-click functionality to your Finder.

## A note on workflows:
You can install by double-clicking on the workflow. (Since Github ZIPs them, you'll have to double-click twice: once to uncompress it, and once to install.)

The Mac OS stores these scripts in Library > Services. If you wish to organize them into subfolders, that's where you put them.

## Files

### Convert to HTML.workflow.zip

If you ever need to just quickly convert things to HTML that you can then edit and do whatever with, this script provides a quick and easy start, with much cleaner output than in-program "Save Asâ€¦" exports tend to be.

This workflow converts a document to HTML via textutil, so once it's installed, you right-click on the file you want converted, select "Services > Convert to HTML", and the Finder will generate an HTML file of the source file. You can then edit, clean up, and manipulate the HTML as you like.

**Images are not included in the conversion.**

This works on RTF, MS Word DOCs, and other formats.

### Remove Spaces from Filename.workflow.zip

Ever need to just remove spaces from the name of something? Install this, and you can replace all spaces with underscores with just a right-click.

To use: Right-click on the file or folder (or files and folders) and select Services > Remove Spaces from Filename. Task done.
