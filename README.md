# helpful_mac_apps
Helpful mini scripts and apps for Mac OS X.

Author's Note
------------
    This is my first time making a repository, so sorry for the roughness.
    
I have a number of scripts I've built and use for myself. This repository specifically covers the ones that are set up for use with the Automator program in the Max OS. Workflows can be installed to add right-click functionality to your Finder.
