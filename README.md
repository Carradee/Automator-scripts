======================
Helpful mini scripts and apps for Mac OS X.

These scripts are **workflows** that add  services to the Mac OS X Finder.

    I have a number of scripts I've built and use for myself. This repository specifically covers the ones that are set up for use with the Automator program in the Max OS. Workflows can be installed to add right-click functionality to your Finder.


### Convert to HTML.workflow.zip

If you ever need to just quickly convert things to HTML that you can then edit and do whatever with, this script provides a quick and easy start, with much cleaner output than in-program "Save As…" exports tend to be.

This workflow converts a document to HTML via textutil. When used, the Finder will generate an HTML file of the source file. You can then edit, clean up, and manipulate the HTML as you like. **Images are not included in this conversion.**

*This works on RTF, MS Word DOCs, and other formats.*

### Remove Spaces from Filename.workflow.zip

Ever need to just remove spaces from the name of one or more files? Install this, and you can replace all spaces with underscores with just a right-click.

About Mac OS X Services/Workflows:
======================
### How to Install
1. Download the service file and unpackage the ZIP archive.
2. Double-click on the downloaded and unpackaged file. The Finder will ask you "Do you want to install the “SERVICE_NAME” service?"
3. Select **Install**.
4. Select **Done**.

### How to Use
   Once installed, you can activate a service by right-clicking the item you need affected, going down to Services, and selecting the name for the service you've installed.

   So, to use the service "Adjust Cover for DriveThru Fiction", open the folder with your cover image in the Finder. Right-click on that image, then find the Services submenu (which is probably the last option on your list). Select the name of the service you need (in this case, "Adjust Cover for DriveThru Fiction").

   **right-click on image in Finder > Services > SERVICE_NAME.**

### How to Find Later
   The scripts are stored in your "Services" folder in your system library. To find it, in the Finder, select the "Go" menu, hold the option key, and select "Library". The Services folder is there.

   **Go menu > ⌥ Library option > Services folder > SERVICE_NAME**
